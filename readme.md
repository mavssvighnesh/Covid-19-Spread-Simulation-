This project is part of my course of python in the college 
the main aim is to build a streamlit dashboard to simulate the spread of covid-19 spread in different locations and populations wise 

the assign 3 file contains the main python code for the simulation to work 
the streamlit_ui.py file contains the code for the streamlit dashboard to run just using command (streamlit run streamlit_ui.py)

keep all the files in the same folder to avoid any errors while working with the project
