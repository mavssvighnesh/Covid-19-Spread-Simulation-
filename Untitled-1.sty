Solid carbon dioxide is called dry ice because it slowly changes from a cold solid directly into a gas.},

	abstract = {With the increasing threatening of the greenhouse effect, taking some measures to reduce carbon emissions is extremely essential. Carbon pricing policy is one of the most powerful tools for reducing emissions. However, most researches focused on carbon emissions allowances trade price prediction, only few investigations paid attention to carbon emissions allowances trade volume prediction. In order to better understand carbon emissions of carbon emissions, this study performed long-term prediction and short-term prediction models to predict carbon emissions trading volume. Linear regression, Decision tree, Random forest, Extreme gradient boosting and Support vector machine were chosen to perform long-term prediction. In these five long-term prediction models, Random Forest performs best with the smallest mean absolute error (24.42). What’s more, a time series forward multi-step hybrid intelligent prediction model (consists of reinforcement learning model, hidden Markov model and neural network) was used to perform short-term prediction, which improves the accuracy and effect of the prediction. The mean absolute error of short-term prediction is 6.79. Our study shows there is a nonlinear relationship between the lag of volume/frequency of transactions and price in the future. The machine learning-based Carbon emissions allowances trade prediction enables traders and environmental organizations to observe the overall carbon emissions trading volume trends and changes as well as judge the short-term trading situation and make judgments.},

	abstract = {Concerns about protecting the environment and reducing the negative effects of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the automotive industry, have raised interest in finding creative and innovative ways to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a variety of sources. This study paper delves deeper into the intriguing possibilities of using machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the amount of CO2 emitted by cars. We are exploring the subject of machine learning to develop a system that can forecast CO2 emissions based on many parameters. Important information about the vehicle, including its make, model, type, number of cylinders, engine size, gearbox type, fuel type, fuel consumption on highways and in cities, and CO2 emission levels, are included in the dataset that serves as the foundation for our study. The creation of accurate and dependable prediction models capable of estimating CO2 emissions from cars is the main goal of this research. Environmental policymakers, customers, and manufacturers may all benefit greatly from these models. To do this, we employ a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques, including ensemble methods, neural networks, decision trees, and regression algorithms, among others. We evaluate the prediction accuracy, scenario handling flexibility, and information processing efficiency of several systems through this study. We determine which machine learning models are most suited for predicting CO2 emissions within the parameters of the given dataset by applying a methodical evaluation approach. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of different feature subsets on prediction performance, shedding light on the relative importance of various vehicle attributes in determining CO2 emissions. Our findings not only contribute to advancing the field of predictive emissions modeling but also offer insights into the key factors driving vehicle-related CO2 emissions.},
